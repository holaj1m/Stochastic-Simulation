# Stochastic-Simulation
Code repository for the Stochastic Simulation course. It features hands-on
implementations of advanced Monte Carlo Methods, Stochastic Optimization, and
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques.

Key topics covered:

1) Random Number Generation (RNG)

2) MCMC Methods: Metropolis Algorithm, Metropolis-Hastings Sampling, and Gibbs Sampling.

3) Stochastic Optimization: Simulated Annealing and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

4) Parallel Tempering and Wang-Landau Algorithm.
